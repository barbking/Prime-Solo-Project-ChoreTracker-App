# My solo project for Prime Digital Academy - The Mom App

The objective of this assignment is to create an application in two weeks that uses full stack software
development tools taught at Prime.

## Summary

As a very busy single parent, I have a hard time keeping track of my children’s activities, chores, and other responsibilities.  I've tried making printable spreadsheets in excel or using pre-made chore checklists but they get lost and kids lose motivation...kids these days are into digital formats and apps.  So I designed the Mom App as a way for myself to keep track of my children’s responsibilities in a way that is easy to access, fun, and hold kids accountable to earn their allowance.  Now I don't have to nag my kids to practice their music lessons every day, they have the Mom App as motivation to complete their responsibilities to earn rewards.

Update post Prime:  I'm very excited to get back to the Mom App post graduation.  While the app had full functionality and instructor feedback was, "You should be proud of this app, it's great work.", I wanted to improve and add some more features.  Every day I am learning new things and want to implement those features in the Mom App to improve it.  I've revamped the styling with additional Bootstrap UI features and added a feature for my kids to earn additional rewards for reading books over the summer.  My son replied with a groan that he didn't want to have to read more books, which is exactly why I'm using a reward system to motivate him.  After the book feature is complete, I will be deploying the Mom App for my kids and me to use.  It's really going to be fun to see this app in action!
