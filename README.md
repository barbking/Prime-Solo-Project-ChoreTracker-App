My solo project for Prime Digital Academy - The Mom App
--------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this assignment is to create an application in two weeks that uses full stack software
development tools taught at Prime.

Summary
--------
*  As a busy single parent, I have a hard time keeping track of my kid's responsibilities.  I lose track
of which child got their chores done or if they got in five practice sessions for their music classes.
Previously, I made up excel spread sheets and tried keeping them on a clipboard in each child's room but they still
got lost or forgotten.  The Mom App makes it easier for all of us in my family to keep track of responsibilities and allow my children to earn an allowance and mangage in their Mom Bank account.
