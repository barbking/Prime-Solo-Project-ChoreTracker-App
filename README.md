# My solo project for Prime Digital Academy - The Mom App

The objective of this assignment is to create an application in two weeks that uses full stack software
development tools taught at Prime.

## Summary

As a very busy single parent, I have a hard time keeping track of my children’s activities, chores and other responsibilities.   I’ve tried making spreadsheet charts in excel and other formats but they get lost and kids lose motivation.  I designed the Mom App as a way for myself to keep track of my children’s responsibilities in a way that is easy to access, fun, and hold kids accountable to earn allowance.
